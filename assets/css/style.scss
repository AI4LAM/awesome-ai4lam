   Summary: allow GitHub Pages version of README to work in dark mode.

   The reason for the existence of this file is to allow the GitHub Pages
   version of the README file to respect the user's dark/light mode settings,
   which is something that the default GitHub Pages theme doesn't do. This
   file was originally based on the approach implemented by user "ggorlen" in
   https://github.com/ggorlen/resources and referenced in a Stack Overflow
   comment on 2023-07-10.
