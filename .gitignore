# The approach used here is to add ONLY project-specific rules in this file.
# Put rules that apply to your way of doing things (and the particular tools
# you use) into a global git ignore file as described in the section
# "Configuring ignored files for all repositories on your computer" here:
# https://docs.github.com/en/get-started/getting-started-with-git/ignoring-files
# (accessed on 2022-07-14). For example, Emacs checkpoint and backup files
# are things that are not specific to a given project; rather, Emacs creates
# them everywhere, in all projects, because they're a byproduct of using
# Emacs, not a consequence of working on a particular project. Thus, a rule to
# ignore them belong in a user's global .gitignore, not a project .gitignore.
#
# A useful starting point for global .gitignore file contents can be found at
# https://github.com/github/gitignore/tree/main/Global (as of 2022-07-14).
